* Projects
Some (but not all) of my projects and projects I contribute to. My "best" projects are marked with ‚ö°, and other notable ones are marked with üåô.

** Common Lisp
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-patterns][cl-patterns]] - Lisp system for writing and performing "algorithmic" music and noise through composition of its library of patterns and function generators. ‚ö°
- [[https://github.com/byulparan/cl-collider][cl-collider]] - A Lisp interface to the SuperCollider audio synthesis server. Not my project, but one I contribute to frequently. ‚ö°
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-collider-tutorial][cl-collider tutorial]] - Tutorial for getting started with cl-collider. Viewable online [[https://defaultxr.github.io/cl-collider-tutorial/][here]].
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/bdef][bdef]] - Lisp system to simplify and improve handling of audio buffers in supported synthesis engines. üåô
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/thundersnow][thundersnow]] - Digital audio workstation and "live coding laboratory" in Lisp, building on cl-patterns and bdef with various graphical interfaces. Currently in very early (pre-alpha) stages of development.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/worm]["worm"]] - Working title for my action/sandbox game in Lisp, inspired by early Sonic and Zelda. Currently private and in very early stages of development.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/sudoku-solver][sudoku-solver]] - A simple (work-in-progress) sudoku solver.

** Emacs
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/tracker-mode][tracker-mode]] - Tracker-inspired sequencer for Emacs. Currently in early stages of development.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/piano-mode][piano-mode]] - Emacs mode that turns your computer keyboard into a "piano keyboard" by translating input events to equivalent MIDI notes.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/tag-edit-mode][tag-edit-mode]] - Emacs major mode for editing file tags (id3, etc).
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/fluxus-mode][fluxus-mode]] - An Emacs mode for interacting with the [[http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/][Fluxus]] live coding environment. Forked from [[https://github.com/lesbroot/fluxus-framework][fluxus-framework]].
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/weechat-log-mode][weechat-log-mode]] - A simple Emacs mode for viewing [[https://weechat.org/][WeeChat]] log files.

** Factor
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/factor-osc][factor-osc]] - Open Sound Control (OSC) vocabulary for Factor. üåô
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/factor-supercollider][factor-supercollider]] - SuperCollider vocabulary for Factor. üåô
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/factor-sexp][factor-sexp]] - S-expression parser for Factor.

** Pure Data
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/xr-abstractions][xr-abstractions]] - Set of Pure Data abstractions including various kinds of sequencers, GUIs, and other utilities. Kind of a mess, but slowly being cleaned up and reworked. üåô

** Python
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/gosd.py][gosd.py]] - Simple OSD script in Python to show the currently-playing track in [[https://musicpd.org][MPD]], as well as the date, time, and other information. üåô
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/taptempo.py][taptempo.py]] - Simple Python script to get the BPM of a tempo by tapping a key from the command line.

** Miscellaneous
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/scripts][scripts]] - A curated collection of some of the scripts I've created. Written in a few different languages (...but mostly Fish). ‚ö°

* Note
GitHub sponsors matches 100% of the donations from the first year, which is why I haven't activated it yet. If you want to sponsor me, let me know and I'll activate it.
