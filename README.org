Some (but not all) of my projects and projects I contribute to. The "best" projects are marked with ‚ö°, and other notable ones are marked with üåô.

** Common Lisp
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-patterns][cl-patterns]] - Lisp system for writing and performing "algorithmic" music and noise through composition of its library of patterns and function generators. ‚ö°
- [[https://github.com/byulparan/cl-collider][cl-collider]] - A Lisp interface to the SuperCollider audio synthesis server. Not my project, but one I like to contribute to. ‚ö°
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-collider-tutorial][cl-collider tutorial]] - Tutorial for getting started with cl-collider. Viewable online [[https://defaultxr.github.io/cl-collider-tutorial/][here]].
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/bdef][bdef]] - Lisp system to simplify and improve handling of audio buffers in supported synthesis engines. üåô
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/thundersnow][thundersnow]] - Digital audio workstation and "live coding laboratory" in Lisp, building on cl-patterns and bdef with various graphical interfaces. Currently in very early (pre-alpha) stages of development.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-alsa-midi][cl-alsa-midi]] - A Common Lisp library for MIDI in Linux via ALSA. Based on [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-alsaseq][cl-alsaseq]] originally written by Richard Venn.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/worm]["worm"]] - Working title for my action/sandbox game in Lisp, inspired by early Sonic and Zelda. Currently private and in very early stages of development.

# - [[https://github.com/defaultxr/sudoku-solver][sudoku-solver]] - A simple (work-in-progress) sudoku solver.

** Emacs
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/tracker-mode][tracker-mode]] - Tracker-inspired sequencer for Emacs. Currently in early stages of development.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/piano-mode][piano-mode]] - Emacs mode that turns your computer keyboard into a "piano keyboard" by translating input events to equivalent MIDI notes.

- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/weechat.el][weechat.el]] - Chat via [[https://weechat.org/][WeeChat]]'s relay protocol in Emacs. [[https://github.com/the-kenny/weechat.el][Originally written]] by [[https://github.com/the-kenny][the-kenny]], but the repo was archived.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/fluxus-mode][fluxus-mode]] - An Emacs mode for interacting with the [[http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/][Fluxus]] live coding environment. Forked from [[https://github.com/lesbroot/fluxus-framework][fluxus-framework]].

- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/factor-sexp][factor-sexp]] - S-expression parser for Factor.
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/search-by-example][search-by-example]] - An attempt at "search by example" functionality for Factor.

** Fennel
- [[https://github.com/defaultxr/multiplicative][multiplicative]] - [[https://mpv.io][mpv]] extension that adds a variety of useful features and improvements, with an emphasis on usability, consistency, and dynamism. Multiply the power of mpv. ‚ö°

** Pure Data

* Note
GitHub sponsors matches 100% of the donations from the first year, which is why I haven't activated it yet. If you want to sponsor me, let me know and I'll activate it.
